`Music Diversity and Circulation: Methods and Indicators` produce the methodology and data assets for the `Report on Music Diversity and Circulation in Europe`. The report is developed following the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines.

`Diversity and Circulation: Methods & Indicators`, following the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](/resources/opa/), develops indicators that capture the cross-border circulation of works/repertoire, the cross-border activities
of artists and professionals, cultural diversity within European music repertoires, and the diversity of representation within music distribution channels. This results in a cross-national legal mapping of regulatory sources that define cultural and creative diversity, have diversity as an underlying goal and/or employ diversity indicators in its operation.

Methodological approaches, data collection instruments, and indicators are discussed in a methodology workshop. Further sectors may be added on the basis of the feedback collected through interviews with policymakers and
stakeholders’ and expert workshops. A cross-national legal mapping will then be conducted. Methods and indicators will be presented in the D5.1 [Open Music Observatory](/resources/open-music-observatory/) as the Music Economy part of broader [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/pillar/music-economy/).
