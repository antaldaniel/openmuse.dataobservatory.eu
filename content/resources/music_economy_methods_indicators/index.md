`D1.1 Economy of music in Europe: Methods and indicators` produce the methodology and data assets for the `Report on the European Music Economy` is developed following the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines.

`D1.1 Economy of music in Europe: Methods and indicators`, following the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](/resources/opa/), identifies critical research questions, data sources and gaps, and data collection methods regarding the economy of music in Europe. It also presents indicators co-developed to measure the economy of music in Europe. The indicator candidates are reviewed and selected indicators are added to the D5.1 [Open Music Observatory](/resources/open-music-observatory/) as the Music Economy part of broader [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/pillar/music-economy/).

We will provide indicators capable of capturing the full economic value of music, including zero-price uses. For this, existing data gaps are identified, analysed and filled. i.e., currently “hidden” data will be reported, MSMEs that currently
do not provide data are integrated, zero-price use is measured, etc. Furthermore, methods to effectively act on this data are demonstrated. 

Examples of potential indicator candidates developed in this deliverable include (but are not limited to):  etc.
