The `Report on Music, Society, and Citizenship in Europe` is developed following the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](/resources/opa/). It will build on the `Music, Society, and Citizenship: Novel data collection methods and indicators` deliverable results (see [below](/resources/music-society-citizenship/#d3-1)).

You can find the repository of all assets on [github.com/dataobservatory-eu/report-music-society-citizenship/](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/report-music-society-citizenship/).

WP3 will analyse and fill data gaps regarding music, society and citizenship in Europe. It will also implement a transferable pilot study to use open data to help MSMEs comply with emerging social and environmental sustainability regulations. The central objectives of WP3 will be to provide indicators that capture social value-adds such as participation in music education, participation in amateur music-making, the role of music in other consumer sectors, and the role of music in social networks; to develop methods for measuring the sustainability of the music industry, in coordination with the SDGs; and to create an open framework for transferring the techniques developed to any willing European market. 

We will furthermore explore synergies with the ongoing MusicAIRE project [Eviota](https://reprex.nl/project/musiceviota/) to avoid risks of duplication of work.


- Open policy analysis of music, society, and citizenship in Europe. The policy analysis will focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility in the music industry, within an SDG framework, as well as the state of the art on
research on the non-economic contributions of music to society, e.g. via the impact of cultural participation on social cohesion and well-being.
- Implementation of a pilot study in Italy. The pilot study will focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility
in the music industry, within an SDG framework. It will demonstrate the ability of reproducible research and innovation
tools to help MSMEs comply with emerging social and environmental sustainability regulations, at a viable cost.
-  Co-creation of policy guidelines and recommendations for scaling and transferring the pilot on an EU27+ level. Using the Open Policy Analysis guidelines, we will demonstrate how to fill partially or fully the data gaps on music, society, and citizenship identified in the Feasibility Study of the European Music Industry. The policy analysis, pilot study design
and results, and transfer potential will be presented in D3.2.

## Music, Society, and Citizenship: Novel data collection methods and indicators {#d3-1}

Following the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines, this deliverable identifies critical research questions, data sources and gaps, and data collection methods regarding music society, and citizenship in Europe. It also presents composite
indicators developed to measure the social value and contributions of music. The second iteration will be reviewed by selected stakeholders. The indicators will furthermore be added to the Open Music Observatory (D5.1).

Examples of potential indicator candidates developed in WP3 include: 
- Music education - informal practices
- Training schemes for music professionals 
- Social networks and music
- Scope of the not-for-profit sector in Europe
- Social impact of music in communities
etc.

This task will focus on the development of indicators following the indicator development cycle of Eurostat, starting with understanding user needs.

Regarding means of measurement, it will update the cultural access and participation (CAP) survey methodologyrecommended in 2012 by ESSnet Culture (as adapted by ARTISJUS, SOZA, and REPREX) in light of new methods developed by the Eurobarometer and European Social Survey core teams in 2020-2022.
- It will close with a user workshop where we will demonstrate to (sub-)national policy users, EU-level policy users, and
music education and business users a general indicator development framework, as well as many indicator candidates
to facilitate a dialogue of needs. The methods and indicators will be presented in 
- We will collect open-source data on cultural access and participation utilising the software package developed in WP4. Relevant data on environmental impacts will also be collected from the European Environmental Agency and
Eurostat using the software package developed in WP4.
- We will conduct new cultural access and participation (CAP) surveys in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Italy. The survey strategy will update the 2012 culture statistics recommendation of ESSnet-Culture in light of 2020-2022
methods and use the ICET model framework to enable comparability with business transaction data. To maximise the accuracy of recall and enable synthesis with financial year business data, the CAP surveys will be carried out in Jan/Feb
2024. The survey results will be retrospectively harmonised with earlier CAP surveys conducted by ARTISJUS, SOZA, the Commissions Eurobarometer survey, and EU-SILC for stability and larger international and historical comparison
dating back to 2007; the piracy surveys of the EUIPO in years 2013; and the piracy research of UVA and SSSA.
- Harmonisation with prior surveys will allow the construction of synthetic longitudinal datasets â€“ one of the outputs will be the comparison of cultural access and participation live and online before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences between social segments and impact on well-being.
- The open collaboration method will be used: all methods and instruments will be fully open, and all data will be harmonised, enabling any representative organisation to localise them and join the action with few time or cost barriers.
Localisation assistance may be provided in partner countries.
