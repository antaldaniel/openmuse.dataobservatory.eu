The `Open-source music data software ecosystem` is developed in an open collaboration on the [rOpenGov](/authors/rOpenGov/) platform managed by the [University of Turku](authors/utu/) and under the strategic direction of [Reprex](/authors/reprex/).

The software solutions have individual (standard) documentation websites, and their development repositories are open for bug reports, improvements or general peer-review. For an overview refer to our [website](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#releases).

Final iteration of an open-source, software-as-a-service (SaaS) ecosystem of tools for music data collection, which improves and integrates the packages [eurostat](https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/index.html), [regions](https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/), [iotables](https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/), [retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/), and [spotifyr](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/spotifyr/index.html). It will be validated by stakeholders and delivered in the form of an open repository with full usability documentation.
