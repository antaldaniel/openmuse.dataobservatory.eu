`Economy of music in Europe: Methods and indicators` produce the methodology and data assets. The `Report on the European Music Economy` is developed following the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines.

The `Report on the European Music Economy`, for full reproducibility, following the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](/resources/opa/), this deliverable is a “live policy document” that is first useful for readers in 2024, but will integrate data as it appears in the pipeline from the inception of the project (and illustration data at the proposal stage). The policy context regarding the economy of music in Europe is described.  Lastly, it analyses the transfer potential of the Bulgarian and Hungarian pilot study to other European music ecosystems, as a new best practice. It is designed to be readable as a stand-alone deliverable, but the data it presents will also be integrated into D5.1 [Open Music Observatory](/resources/open-music-observatory/) as the Music Economy part of broader [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/pillar/music-economy/).


`D1.1 Economy of music in Europe: Methods and indicators`, following the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](/resources/opa/), identifies critical research questions, data sources and gaps, and data collection methods regarding the economy of music in Europe. It also presents indicators co-developed to measure the economy of music in Europe. The indicator candidates are reviewed and selected indicators are added to the D5.1 [Open Music Observatory](/resources/open-music-observatory/) as the Music Economy part of broader [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/pillar/music-economy/).

We will provide indicators capable of capturing the full economic value of music, including zero-price uses. For this, existing data gaps are identified, analysed and filled. i.e., currently “hidden” data will be reported, MSMEs that currently
do not provide data are integrated, zero-price use is measured, etc. Furthermore, methods to effectively act on this data are demonstrated. 

Examples of potential indicator candidates developed in this deliverable include (but are not limited to):  etc.

A pilot study demonstrates exemplary how improved data collection on the value of music can be leveraged to improve artist revenues.
